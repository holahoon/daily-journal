## Project overview
`userDataObject` is set to `null` when the user is not logged in. This state will receive an object once the user signs up or logs in. Once the user is authenticated, the user will be automatically redirected to the main page and will not have access to the auth page as there is no need.
**update** `userDtaObject` is being set in the App.js atm. Planning on using a context api so the state does not need to be passed down parent to child directly.
